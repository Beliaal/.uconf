## - BREAKING CHANGE: a commit that has a footer BREAKING CHANGE:, or appends a ! after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change
## - (correlating with MAJOR in semantic versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.

## - types other than fix: and feat: are allowed, for example @commitlint/config-conventional (based on the the Angular convention) recommends:
## - 'perf' 'build', 'ci', 'chore', 'docs', 'feat', 'fix', 'perf', 'refactor', 'revert', 'style', 'test'
